# Checklist for developers

# Audit early

By monitoring your performance during development can save a lot of time in the future refactoring your storefront.
[Webpagetest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) is one of the most advance tools for analyzing performance, it can generate automated reports, provide charts, simulate devices and regions, insights into network requests and much more. You can also learn from experts from their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@webpagetestbycatchpoint8707).

# Offline and poor connection

It is common to find bugs on online shops when you have poor internet connection. Try simulating poor connection or [offline mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#offline) and go through critical path such as `add to bag` or `checkout`. The goal is not to make application offline ready, but rather to make sure that application doesn't get into unusable state when some of the requests are dropped.

## Next.js checklist

Make sure that pages are rendered on the server by [blocking](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/disable/) `javascript` files.
Things to look for:

• Images above the fold are visible.

• There is no difference between layout, for example missing navigation or footer.

Other tips:

• Use Next `<Image/>` component. In addition to optimization that you get out of the box allows to serve images from the same domain as your storefront which decreases

• Load 3rd party scripts efficiently [lazyOnload or worker](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script)

# Migration

• If you are migrating from `www` to `non-www` make sure all stakeholders understand the impact on SEO and performance.

• If you are adding channels slug to the URL make sure to communicate to stakeholders.

• Use tracking tools like Google Analytics to check for existing URLs that need redirects.

• Test quality of customer data after migration, for example if existing customers can complete checkout with their existing shipping or billing addresses.

• Check if geographic redirects working by using VPN.

# Cost optimization

### Saleor and CMS

Use server side rendering when possible to reduce amount of requests by sharing cache between visitors.

### Search and lookup services

[Debounce](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/javascript/debounce/) search input fields, specially useful for servies like Algolia and Google maps, that charge for API requests.

_Tip:_ Make sure requests are not throttled but rather reset on each keystroke.

### Vercel

Follow this official [guide](https://vercel.com/guides/lower-usage) to lower Vercel usage.

Additional tips:

• [Prefetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#prefetch) could increase cache costs specially when your traffic is global. Beware that this is a performance tradeoff.

• Check your build logs to find the size of your serverless functions to and set [memory allocation](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-reduce-my-serverless-execution-usage-on-vercel#configuring-your-serverless-functions) accordingly.

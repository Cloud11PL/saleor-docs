# Checklist for developers

# Audit early

Monitoring your performance during development can save a lot of time refactoring your future storefront.
[Webpagetest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) is one of the most advanced tools for analyzing performance; it can generate automated reports, provide charts, simulate devices and regions, insights into network requests, and much more. You can also learn from experts from their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@webpagetestbycatchpoint8707).

# Offline and poor connection

It is common to find bugs in online shops when you have a poor internet connection. Try simulating poor connection or [offline mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#offline) and go through critical path steps such as `add to bag` or `checkout`. The goal is not to make the application offline-ready but rather to make sure that application doesn't get into unusable state when some of the requests are dropped.

## Next.js checklist

Ensure that pages are rendered on the server by [blocking](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/disable/) `javascript` files.
Things to look for:

• Images above the fold are visible.

• There is no difference between layouts, such as missing navigation or footer.

Other tips:

• Use Next `<Image/>` component. In addition to optimization that you get out of the box, it serves images from the same domain as your storefront, which omits DNS lookup.

• Load 3rd party scripts efficiently [lazyOnload or worker](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script)

# Migration

• If you are migrating from `www` to `non-www` ensure all stakeholders understand the impact on SEO and performance.

• If you are adding channels slug to the URL, inform stakeholders.

• Use tracking tools like Google Analytics to check for existing URLs that need redirects.

• TTest customer data quality after migration, for example, if existing customers can complete checkout with their existing shipping or billing addresses.

• Check if geographic redirects are working by using VPN.

# Cost optimization

### Saleor and CMS

Use server-side rendering when possible to reduce the number of requests by sharing cache between visitors.

### Search and lookup services

[Debounce](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/javascript/debounce/) search input fields, beneficial for services like Algolia and Google Maps, that charge for API requests.

_Tip:_ Ensure requests are not throttled but reset on each keystroke.

### Vercel

Follow this official [guide](https://vercel.com/guides/lower-usage) to lower Vercel usage.

Additional tips:

• [Prefetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#prefetch) could increase cache costs especially when your traffic is global. Beware that this is a performance tradeoff.

• Check your build logs to find the size of your serverless functions and set [memory allocation](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-reduce-my-serverless-execution-usage-on-vercel#configuring-your-serverless-functions) accordingly.
